I wrote my first graphics framework during High School, with DirectX, C# and HLSL, and I used it to build some nice 3D simulations and other fancy stuff. Recently I made some works with WebGL , Blender & GLSL I am Full-Stack Web Developer since 2010. I worked in companies located in Italy (Torino) and USA (Sunnyvale, CA), developing Web Applications with Ruby on Rails , Node.js/Express , Angular and some other frameworks. Hey, this site is made with Jekyll ! Currently I work as Graphics Programmer at Tiny Bull Studios, an indie game developer that's making a cool VR project . I also like to develop small videogames in my spare time using Unity , MonoGame or other web technologies. I also used to attend many game jams around the world, as I did in Torino, Roma and San Francisco."><title>Introducing Myself</title><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/main.e306.css><!-- HTML5 Shim and Respond.js IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries --><!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file:// --><!--[if lt IE 9]>

Chosko), and I am a Graphics Programmer based in Torino, Italy.</p><p>I like computers since I was a child, because my father used to spend some of his free time playing videogames and reading IT journals. I just watched and learned everything he did.</p><p>My passion for computer graphics started when I was 15 years old. At that time <a href=mailto:stefano.nada@gmail.com>Stefano Nada</a>, a friend of mine, sent me a picture of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot>Utah teapot</a> with an amazing mix of lights, reflections and HDR. That&#39;s when I decided what I wanted to do in my life: from that day I started studying computer graphics, using C#, DirectX and HLSL.</p><p>Stefano and I started working on some personal projects. The most important was a graphics framework based on DirectX, which I also used for my thesis (&quot;Mathematics applied to 3D Computer Graphics Programming&quot;) at the end of the High School. During the final test I showed to the exam commission a <a href=http://github.com/Chosko/high-school-thesis target=_blank>simulation of the solar system</a>, entirely made with our framework.</p><p><img src=/img/post/saturn.863c.png alt="A screenshot of the simulation presented for the thesis" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 12px"> <em>This is a screenshot of the simulation presented for my thesis at the High School</em></p><p>When I started University, in order to pay the fees I also had to start working as Full-Stack Developer. Although it started as a need, Web Development quickly became a secondary passion and I kept doing it during the whole University. In those years I worked both in Italy and California and I gained experience with many languages and frameworks, such as <a href=http://rubyonrails.org>Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Node.js/Express</a>.</p><p>I got a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science in 2012 and a Master&#39;s degree in Virtual Reality in 2017, the latter with the thesis &quot;Visual effects for real-time stereoscopic rendering&quot;. Both the degrees were accomplished with the maximum score of 110/100 with honors.</p><p>In 2016 I also managed to move from Web Development to Game Programming, as I started working as Graphics Programmer at <a href=http://www.tinybullstudios.com>Tiny Bull Studios</a>, an Indie Game Developer that makes VR games. There I mostly implement visual effects for virtual reality, writing shaders and setting up particle systems.</p><div class=embed-video><iframe width=560 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSh4QCj9G9I?rel=0" frameborder=0 allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><em>Announce trailer of the VR game &quot;Blind&quot;, currently under development at Tiny Bull Studios</em></p></div></div></div><hr class=featurette-divider><!-- FOOTER --><footer style="margin-top: 25px"><p class=pull-right><a href=#content-top class=btn-link>Back to Top</a></p><p>&copy; 2014-<span class=current-year>2017</span> &middot; Ruben Caliandro &middot; All rights are reserved</p></footer></div><!-- /.container --><script src=/js/scripts.f974.js></script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
