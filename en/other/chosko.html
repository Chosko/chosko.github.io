Chosko), and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Turin (Italy).</p><p>I like computers since I was a child, because my father used to spend some of his free time playing videogames and reading IT journals. I just watched and learned everything he did.</p><p>My passion for computer graphics started in 2005 (15 years old), when <a href=mailto:stefano.nada@gmail.com>Stefano Nada</a> sent me a picture of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot>Utah teapot</a> with a nice mix of lights, reflections and HDR. Since that time, we started studying computer graphics, learning C#, DirectX 9.0c and HLSL.</p><p>Until I went to University (in 2009), we worked on some personal projects. The most important was a simple framework based on DirectX, which I also used for my thesis (&quot;Mathematics applied to the 3D Computer Graphics Programming&quot;) at the end of High School. During the final exam, as a demo I presented a <a href=http://github.com/Chosko/high-school-thesis target=_blank>simulation of the solar system</a>, entirely made with our framework.</p><p><img src=/img/post/saturn.80f0.png alt="A screenshot of the simulation presented for the thesis" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 12px"> <em>This is a screenshot of the simulation presented for my thesis at the High School</em></p><p>Later I started University (Computer Science), and meanwhile I also worked 3 years in a company as Web Developer. In these years I put aside Computer Graphics and focused on Java, C, PHP, SQL (MySQL) and the main client-side languages ([X]HTML, CSS, Javascript).</p><p>After I graduated (B.Sc.) in 2012, I enrolled in the Master of Science program (Virtual Reality) and at the same time I started working for <a href=http://www.mytable.it>another company</a>, still as Web Developer. This time I met <a href=http://rubyonrails.org>Ruby on Rails</a>, that totally changed my way of working on Web.</p><p>Lately I resumed my passion for Computer Graphics, especially for Game Development, and I have been involved in projects with XNA (<a href="http://www.monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>) and <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>.</p></div></div></div><hr class=featurette-divider><!-- FOOTER --><footer style="margin-top: 25px"><p class=pull-right><a href=#content-top class=btn-link>Back to Top</a></p><p>&copy; 2014 Ruben Caliandro &middot; All rights are reserved</p></footer></div><!-- /.container --></body></html>
